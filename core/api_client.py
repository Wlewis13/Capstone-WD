# -------------------------------------------------------------
# Summary of What This Code Does:
# -------------------------------------------------------------
# - This script defines a function `fetch_weather_data(city)` that fetches both
#   current weather and 5-day forecast data for a given city using the OpenWeatherMap API.
#
# - It sends HTTP GET requests to two endpoints:
#     1. `/weather` for current weather conditions
#     2. `/forecast` for a detailed forecast
#
# - It uses an API key to authenticate requests and retrieves the data in imperial units (Â°F).
#
# - The function parses the JSON response and validates that the city was found and
#   the response is valid (even if status code is 200, the API might return "city not found").
#
# - If successful, it returns the weather and forecast as Python dictionaries.
#
# - If any error occurs (network error, timeout, bad response, etc.), the function will
#   print a clear error message and exit the program using `SystemExit`.
#
# - This function is a foundational part of any weather app and is responsible for communicating
#   with the API and ensuring that only valid, usable data reaches the rest of your application.
