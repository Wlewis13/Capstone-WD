# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Summary of What This Code Does:
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# This script defines a function called `save_weather_to_csv()` that takes three parameters:
#   - `city`: The name of the city (used for labeling the file and CSV content).
#   - `data`: A dictionary that includes both current weather data and 5-day forecast data.
#   - `folder`: (optional) The folder where the CSV file will be saved. Defaults to "exports".

# Here's how the function works:

# 1. It creates the specified folder if it doesn't exist using `os.makedirs()`.
# 2. It generates a unique filename using the city name and the current timestamp (down to seconds).
#    Example: exports/Atlanta_20250804_194523.csv
# 3. It opens the file in write mode with UTF-8 encoding.
# 4. It writes a row of headers and a single row of current weather data:
#    - Temperature, Humidity, Weather Description, Sunrise, Sunset
# 5. It leaves a blank row for separation.
# 6. Then, it writes the forecast data:
#    - Each forecast entry includes date, time, temperature, and weather condition.
#    - The forecast data comes from `data["forecast"]["list"]` (typically 8 entries per day).
#    - These entries reflect 3-hour interval predictions from the OpenWeatherMap API.

# 7. After writing all data, the function returns the full path to the created CSV file.

# This function is useful for exporting weather reports in a format that can be easily opened
# in spreadsheet programs like Excel, shared via email, or archived for later analysis.
